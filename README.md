# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Analysis & Patient Health Overview

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes diabetes risk across BMI categories and lifestyle factors using healthcare data.  
The objective is to identify high-risk patient groups and provide actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard to support preventive healthcare decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze diabetes prevalence across BMI categories  
- Compare diabetic vs non-diabetic populations  
- Identify high-risk groups based on BMI, glucose levels, and physical activity  
- Build an interactive Power BI dashboard  
- Showcase end-to-end data analytics skills for portfolio and interviews  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** – Data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering  
- **SQL** – Data storage, joins, aggregations, analytical queries  
- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX measures, dashboard visualization  
- **DAX** – KPI calculations, ratios, and healthcare metrics  


---

### Key KPIs
- Total Patients  
- Diabetes Prevalence (%)  
- Average BMI  
- Average Glucose Level  

### Key Visualizations
- BMI Category vs Diabetes Status (Stacked Column Chart)  
- Physical Activity vs Diabetes Risk  
- Glucose Level Distribution  
- Patient Demographic Analysis  

---

## 🧩 Key Insights
- Diabetic patients show higher average BMI and glucose levels  
- Obese patients have the highest diabetes prevalence  
- Low physical activity significantly increases diabetes risk  
- High-risk populations can be identified for early preventive care  

---

## 🧠 Healthcare Impact
This dashboard helps healthcare stakeholders:
- Detect high-risk individuals early  
- Support data-driven preventive care strategies  
- Improve public health decision-making  
- Optimize healthcare resource allocation  

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements
- Add machine learning models for diabetes risk prediction  
- Include time-based trend analysis  
- Implement Power BI Row-Level Security (RLS)  
- Connect real-time cloud data sources
